    <p> The UAFUZZ directed fuzzing module of BINSEC has discovered <b>30 new bugs in 6 widely used programs</b> (GPAC, GNU Patch, Perl 5, MuPDF, Boolector, fontforge), made of 1.9M lines of code. In September 2020, <b>17 of these bugs had been fixed</b> by the vendors and <b>7 have resulted in new CVEs</b>. </p>

    <p> Our BINSEC/REL relational symbolic execution module has analysed 338 cryptographic primitives (from e.g. HACL*, OpenSSL, BearSSL and NaCL), notably <b>proving that 296 of the binaries were resilient to cache-based timing attacks</b>, while <b>finding 3 new binary-level vulnerabilities</b> (from secure source codes), introduced by the compiler.</p>

    <p>In less than 1/2 hour, the TInA assembly lifter module of BINSEC has <b>securely translated 2000+ x86 or ARM assembly chunks to C</b>, all extracted from a typical Debian Linux distribution (including FFMPEG, ALSA and GMP), <b>enhancing</b> so <b>automatic code analyses of Linux</b> at the C level. </p>
