# Motivation
**Timing channels** are software vunelrabilities happening when execution times in a program depend
on *secret* information. They can be exploited by an attacker to
recover this secret information, such as plaintext data or secret keys.

Take for instance the following `password_checker` program, which compares a secret
`password` to an attacker controlled `guess`:

``` c
bool password_checker(char *password, char *guess, int length) {
 for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
    if (guess[i] != password[i]) return false;
 }
 return true;
}
```

The function iterates through each character of the `guess` and returns
`false` as soon as there is a mismatch with the actual password.  Let `PasSw0rD` be this
actual password. Notice that the attempt `Myguess?` will fail after
only one iteration of the loop, whereas the attempt `Password` will fail after three loop iterations. An attacker can thus *measure the
execution time* of the function with different values of `guess`, in order to
recover the secret value of `password` one character at a time.

More sophisticated attacks also exploit timing variations resulting
from uses of the CPU cache. For instance, an attacker can *monitor the cache* to
retrieve information about the *memory addresses* accessed by a
victim.


## Constant-Time Programming
To protect against these timing attacks, cryptogtaphic libraries such
as OpenSSL, Libsodium, etc., use **constant-time programming**.  It basically means that the program is designed in such a way that
the **control-flow and the memory accesses are independent from the
secrets**.

Formally, *two executions of a program that only differ in their
secret input must have the same control-flow and the same memory
accesses*.

For instance, a constant-time implementation of our `password_checker` function would be:
``` c
int ct_password_checker(char *password, char *guess, int length) {
    int result = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < length, ++i) {
        result |= password[i] ^ guess[i];
    }
    return result; 
}
```


## Challenges of Constant-Time Verification
Writing constant-time code is difficult as it usually deviates from
traditional programming behaviors (for instance, it requires a lot of
bitwise operations), and compiler can sometimes put a spoke in the
developer's wheel by optimizing away constant-time protections (see
[[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8406587)).

Consider
for instance the following constant-time selection function:
``` c
uint32_t ct_select_u32_v4(uint32_t x, uint32_t y, bool bit) {
  signed b = 0-bit;
  return (x&b) | (y&~b);
}
```
Compiled with `clang -m32 -march=i386 -O0` (i.e. all compiler optimizations off), this function is compiled
to constant-time binary code, whereas with `clang -m32 -march=i386 -O3` (i.e. all compiler optimizations on), it is
compiled to a conditional jump, violating constant-time.
For this reason, we have to **check constant-time directly on the binary**.

A second challenge, is that constant-time relates *two executions* of
a program, contrary to usual properties that guarantee the absence
of bugs along *one execution*. Therefore, common bug-finding tools are not directly applicable to constant-time and we need tools
that can **efficiently reason about pairs of executions**.

*This is why we need **efficient** verification tools for
constant-time operating at **binary level**.*

Unfortunately existing techniques operate at a higher-level (C or
LLVM), or do not provide necessary guarantees for bug-finding and
verification, or do not scale on real-world cryptographic
implementations.

# Contributions
*We tackle the problem of designing an **efficient** tool that is both
able to **find bugs** or **verify** that a program is
**constant-time**, and which operates **binary level**.*

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
- We design **dedicated optimizations** to make the symbolic execution code analysis technique amenable for constant-time analysis at
  binary level. We formally prove that our analysis is correct for
  bug-finding and bounded-verification of constant-time.
- We propose a verification tool named **Binsec/Rel** and evaluate it
  against standard approaches on 338 cryptographic binaries, reporting
  a Ã—700 speedup compared to standard approaches.
- Using Binsec/Rel, we perform an **extensive analysis of constant time at
  binary-level**: we analyze 296 cryptographic implementations
  previously verified at a higher-level, and replay known bugs in 42
  programs (including **x86** and **ARM** binaries).
- We automate and extend a **study on constant-time preservation by
  compilers**. Interestingly, we discovered that `gcc -O0` and backend
  passes of `clang` with `-O3 -m32 -march=i386` *introduce violations
  of constant-time that cannot be detected by LLVM verification tools,
  showing the importance of reasoning at binary level*.

Binsec/Rel is shown to be efficient on bug-finding and
bounded-verification, paving the way to systematic binary-level
analysis of constant-time on cryptographic implementations, while our
experiments demonstrate the importance of developing constant-time
verification tools reasoning at binary-level.
