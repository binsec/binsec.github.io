We have one open position to <strong>work for 4-6 months as an intern on uncovering backdoors in real-world software</strong>.

<strong>TITLE</strong> - Assessing Backdoor Detection Tools in Real-World Scenarios.

<strong>TOPIC</strong> - Backdoors in software are stealthy, malicious functionalities that can grant unauthorized access or escalate privilegesâ€”often triggered by obscure, secret inputs. Imagine hard-coded credentials silently embedded in a file serverâ€™s codebase, giving attackers global access with a single exploit.

At the forefront of cybersecurity research, our team is developing cutting-edge tools to automatically detect such threats in source or binary code (see [Kokkonis et al.][ICSE2025]). As an intern, youâ€™ll play a key role in evaluating these tools against real-world software, helping us understand their strengths, limitations, and potential for deployment in critical systems. 

ðŸ’¡ **What Youâ€™ll Do**

* Work hands-on with advanced code analysis tools.
* Test and validate detection capabilities on real software projects.
* Collaborate with researchers to refine methodologies.
* Contribute to the future of secure software development.

ðŸŽ¯ **Who Weâ€™re Looking For**

* Passionate about cybersecurity, software engineering, or code analysis.
* Familiar with code reverse engineering, vulnerability detection, or fuzzing (languages: x86/ARM assembly, C/C++, Linux scripting).
* Curious, analytical, and eager to make an impact.

ðŸŒ± **What Youâ€™ll Gain**

* Experience in a high-impact research environment.
* Mentorship from experts in software security.
* A chance to contribute to published research and real-world tools.

<strong>KEYWORDS</strong> - software security, reverse engineering, backdoors, fuzzing

<strong>SUPERVISION</strong> - Supervision will be provided by [MichaÃ«l Marcozzi][marcozzi], with some help from [Dimitri Kokkonis][kokkonis].

<strong>HOSTING</strong> - You will be hosted at the [CEA offices, part of the Paris-Saclay research cluster][nano].

<strong>To apply, please check out the [detailed application procedure and job info][procedure]</strong>.

<strong>When to apply</strong> - As soon as possible, directly by email to [MichaÃ«l Marcozzi][marcozzi]! We process applications as soon as they arrive (depending on our own availability ^^), so don't be too late.
