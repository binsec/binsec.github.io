## About us
**OUR TEAM** - The BINary-level SECurity research group (BINSEC) is a dynamic team of [9 junior and 4 senior researchers][team]. The group has [frequent publications][publications] in top-tier security, formal methods and software engineering conferences. We work in close collaboration with other French and international research teams, industrial partners and national agencies. The team is part of Université Paris-Saclay, the world’s 13th and European Union’s 1st university, according to the Shanghai ARWU Ranking in 2021.  

**OUR WORK** - The team has high-level expertise in several binary code analysis approaches, namely abstract interpretation, fuzzing and symbolic execution. We apply these techniques to [improve software security][walloffame] at the binary level, covering notably vulnerability detection, code (de)obfuscation and formal verification. See [our website][website] for additional information. 

## Job offer for Ph.D. position
**YOUR MISSION** - The goal of your doctoral work will be to classify advanced software vulnerabilities and design techniques to detect them with [greybox][greybox] or [hybrid][hybrid] fuzzing. Under the supervision of our senior researchers, you will be expected to solve research problems, implement your solutions into evaluated prototypes, publish at top conferences and journals, mentor interns and broadly participate in the scientific life of the team. The position comprises both theoretical work and coding. You will be able to dedicate a small fraction of your time to teaching if you want so. Our former team members have been able to secure stimulating positions in academia or industry and we will support you in advancing your career.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS** - Successful candidates should have (or be close to have) a Master in Computer Science (or equivalent), with strong results in topics related to the doctoral work that they would conduct in our team. They should be proficient in English and have excellent programming skills. Authorship of one or several scientific publications is a plus. 

**HIRING PROCEDURE** - Candidates should send a *CV*, a *cover letter*, a *transcript of their university results*, as well as *contact information of two referees* to <binsec-jobs@saxifrage.saclay.cea.fr> **as soon as possible** (and at the very last by January 2022). Applications will be reviewed immediately as they arrive (first come, first served). The position is expected to start during **the first half of 2022** and will have a duration of 3 years. The hiring procedure will involve requesting a security clearance from the French Government (for all candidates, 1-3 months delay) and obtaining a visa to work in France (for non-european candidates only).

**REMUNERATION PACKAGE** - Remuneration includes a gross salary of around 25 kEUR per year, full access to the French national healthcare, social care and pension system, as well as several other benefits, like coverage of 75% of your Parisian public transport subscription or preferential access to all staff restaurants.

## Job offer for postdoc position
**YOUR MISSION** - The goal of your postdoc will be to leverage recent advances in symbolic execution, fuzzing, static analysis and/or machine learning to develop methods and tools supporting vulnerability detection at the binary level. 
You will be expected to solve challenging research problems, implement your solutions into evaluated prototypes, publish at top conferences and journals, mentor students and broadly participate to the scientific life of the team. You will also be involved in the EU-funded [IRIS][iris] project, together with senior members of the team. The position comprises both theoretical work and coding. Our former team members have been able to secure stimulating positions in academia or industry and we will support you in advancing your career.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS** - Successful candidates should have (or be close to have) a Ph.D. in Computer Science. They should be proficient in English and have excellent programming skills. Some coding experience in OCAML is a plus. We are mainly looking for applicants with an excellent research track record in symbolic execution, fuzzing, static analysis and/or machine learning. However, candidates with a strong background in software engineering, information security, programming languages, architecture or systems may also be considered. 

**HIRING PROCEDURE** - Candidates should send a *CV*, a *cover letter*, as well as *contact information of three referees* to <binsec-jobs@saxifrage.saclay.cea.fr> **as soon as possible** (and at the very last by January 2022). Applications will be reviewed immediately as they arrive (first come, first served). The position is expected to start **as soon as possible in 2022** and will have a duration of 3 years. The hiring procedure will involve requesting a security clearance from the French Government (for all candidates, 1-3 months delay) and obtaining a visa to work in France (for non-european candidates only).

**REMUNERATION PACKAGE** - Remuneration includes a gross salary ranging from 33 kEUR to 39 kEUR per year, full access to the French national healthcare, social care and pension system, as well as several other benefits, like coverage of 75% of your Parisian public transport subscription or preferential access to all staff restaurants.

## Work environment
**WORKING AND LIVING IN PARIS** - Our offices are located at [Nano-Innov][nano], in Plateau de Saclay, south of Paris, Europe’s biggest research and industry cluster. Agencies like [Science Accueil][scienceaccueil] or [Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris][ciup] are available to help foreign candidates find their home and settle here. Most of us live either in the wooden and quiet southern suburbs of Paris or closer to the bustling historical center of the city. Paris is the capital of France, a metropolis of 12.5 million people and one of the most visited travel destinations in the world.
