## About us
**OUR TEAM** - The BINary-level SECurity research group (BINSEC) is a dynamic team of [9 junior and 4 senior researchers][team], which offers a **stimulating and open-minded scientific environment in English** to all its members. The group has [frequent publications][publications] in top-tier security, formal methods and software engineering conferences. We work in close collaboration with other French and international research teams, industrial partners and national agencies. The team is part of Université Paris-Saclay, the world’s 16th and European Union’s 1st university, according to the Shanghai ARWU Ranking in 2022.  

**OUR WORK** - The team has high-level expertise in several code analysis approaches, namely abstract interpretation, fuzzing and symbolic execution. We apply these techniques to [improve software security][walloffame], covering notably vulnerability detection and analysis, code (de)obfuscation and formal verification. See [our website][website] for additional information. 

**WORKING AND LIVING IN PARIS** - Our offices are located in [Nano-Innov][nano], at the heart of Plateau de Saclay, south of Paris, Europe’s biggest research and industry cluster. Agencies like [Science Accueil][scienceaccueil] or [Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris][ciup] are available to help foreign candidates find their home and settle here. Most of us live either in the wooden and quiet southern suburbs of Paris or closer to the bustling historical center of the city. Paris is the capital of France, a metropolis of 12.5 million people and one of the most visited travel destinations in the world.

## Topics

Available topics notably **involve but are not strictly limited** to: 

**EFFICIENT FUZZING** - Fuzzing refers to a process of repeatedly running a program with automatically generated inputs to discover bugs, which can then be fixed. A major challenge in the field is moving from indistinct program exploration towards efficient triggering of dangerous vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of our team’s expertise and previous works, the selected candidate will explore ways to overcome this challenge. 

**UNDERSTANDING ADVANCED VULNERABILITIES** - Mitigation and exploitation of software vulnerabilities is a game of cat and mouse. The resulting arms race can lead attackers to rely on more and more complex vectors, such as exploit chains, backdoors, microarchitectural or side-channel attacks. The selected candidate will be responsible for exploring, documenting and streamlining (parts of) the landscape of advanced security vulnerabilities and  ways to mitigate them.


## Details of postdoc positions

**YOUR MISSION** - Following the guidelines of our senior researchers, you will be expected to solve challenging research problems, implement your solutions into evaluated prototypes, publish at top conferences and journals, mentor students and broadly participate to the scientific life of the team. The position comprises both theoretical work and coding. You will be able to dedicate a small fraction of your time to teaching if you want so. Our former team members have been able to secure stimulating positions in academia or industry and we will support you in advancing your career.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS** - Successful candidates should have (or be close to have) a **Ph.D. in Computer Science**. They should be proficient in English and have good programming skills. We are primarily looking for candidates with a good research experience in one or more of the following domains: software security, formal methods, software engineering, programming languages, architecture or systems. 

**HIRING PROCEDURE** - Candidates should send a *CV* to <binsec-jobs@saxifrage.saclay.cea.fr> **as soon as possible**. Applications will be reviewed immediately as they arrive (first come, first served). Each position is expected to start as soon as possible (upon completion of all administrative requirements) and will have a duration of 2 years.

**YOUR MISSION** - Under the supervision of our senior researchers, you will be expected to solve research problems, implement your solutions into evaluated prototypes, publish at top conferences and journals and broadly participate in the scientific life of the team. The position comprises both theoretical work and coding. You will be able to dedicate a small fraction of your time to teaching if you want so. Our former team members have been able to secure stimulating positions in academia or industry and we will support you in advancing your career.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS** - Successful candidates should have (or be close to have) a **Master (or equivalent) in Computer Science**, with good results in topics related to the doctoral work that they would conduct in our team. They should be persistent, rigorous, motivated and curious, they should have proficiency in English, as well as good programming skills. Authorship of a scientific publication or real-world coding experience are a plus. 

**HIRING PROCEDURE** - Candidates should send a *CV* to <binsec-jobs@saxifrage.saclay.cea.fr> **as soon as possible**. Applications will be reviewed immediately as they arrive (first come, first served). Each position is expected to start as soon as possible (upon completion of all administrative requirements) and will have a duration of 3 years. 

## Details of internships

**YOUR MISSION** - Under the close supervision of our senior researchers (and possibly postdocs), you will be expected to help the team solve research problems, either by reviewing scientific litterature, or by testing and formalising reserach ideas, or by coding research prototypes, or by conducting research experiments.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS** - Successful candidates should be **preparing a Master (or equivalent) in Computer Science**, with good results in topics related to the work that they would conduct in our team. 

**HIRING PROCEDURE** - Candidates should send a *CV* to <binsec-jobs@saxifrage.saclay.cea.fr> **as soon as possible**. Applications will be reviewed immediately as they arrive (first come, first served). Each position is expected to start as soon as possible (upon completion of all administrative requirements) and will have a duration of 2.5 to 6 months. Successful interships may open the door to doing a PhD in the team.
