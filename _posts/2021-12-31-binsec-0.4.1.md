Check out the improvements we have just released with <a href="https://github.com/binsec/binsec/blob/master/INSTALL.md">version 0.4.1</a> of our BINSEC platform.

First and foremost, **64-bit architectures** are now supported! Install the experimental decoder <code class="highlighter-rouge">unisim_archisec</code>
(available on <a href="https://github.com/binsec/unisim_archisec">github</a> or through <code class="highlighter-rouge">opam</code>) to support
<code class="highlighter-rouge">x86-64</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARMv8</code> architectures. As a bonus, it also ships with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARMv7</code> support, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">Thumb</code> mode.

Then, welcome to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitwuzla</code> SMT solver, winner of the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">QF_ABV</code> <a href="https://smt-comp.github.io/2020/">SMT-COMP 2020</a> track.
**Better solver, better symbolic reasoning.**
In addition, BINSEC's new support of the <a href="https://github.com/bitwuzla/ocaml-bitwuzla">native binding</a>
should help smoothen the cost of satisfiability queries.

64-bits support and bitwuzla may help performing more scalable symbolic analyses,
yet provided the tool is used properly... Let us introduce the **redesign** of
the **Static Symbolic Execution** (<code class="highlighter-rouge">sse</code>) and
the **Backward Bounded Symbolic Execution** (<code class="highlighter-rouge">bbsse</code>).
Both have been reworked with **better usability** in mind and, more importantly,
**documentation** comes with some <a href="https://github.com/binsec/binsec/tree/master/examples">examples</a> and <a href="https://github.com/binsec/binsec/tree/master/doc">writes-up</a>.

Last but not least, we are **making BINSEC ready to change even more in the future**. As we have seen, features
are being reworked. Sadly, others have been temporarily disabled, like
Concolic Execution (<code class="highlighter-rouge">dse</code>) and Abstract Interpretation (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ai</code>), which mostly gathered dust in our codebase (do not worry, there are still
present in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.3</code> <a href="https://github.com/binsec/binsec/commit/31e0190811f9a910a710752d598b4992563ee951">source tree</a> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">opam</code> release).
Thanks to this, we managed to drop or lighten some system dependencies.

Together with the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">dune</code> build system, **BINSEC has never been so easy to
build from <a href="https://github.com/binsec/binsec">sources</a>**. Wanna give a try? Follow the <a href="https://github.com/binsec/binsec/blob/master/INSTALL.md">install instructions</a>.
Stay tuned as we may keep in sync fixes and small improvements. 

**In a hurry? We are also maintaining the official <code class="highlighter-rouge">opam</code> release. Just run the following:**
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>opam depext <span class="nt">-i</span> bitwuzla unisim_archisec binsec
</code></pre></div></div>

See you soon! :-)
