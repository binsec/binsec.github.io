We have one open position to <strong>work for 3 years as a PhD student or Postdoc on symbolic machine learning for binary code reverse engineering</strong>.

<strong>TITLE</strong> - Automatically infer program annotations to help reverse engineering, code understanding and verification.

<strong>TOPIC</strong> - Function annotations, like function [pre/postconditions][HOARE], enable to specify code behaviors formally. Thus, they are highly valuable in reverse engineering, software engineering and program verification. Unfortunately, such annotations are rarely available and must be retrofitted by hand. The goal of this work is to devise new efficient approaches based on [symbolic machine learning][CA] and formal methods to infer automatically complex annotations with good correctness guarantees. It must be able to handle software hard to analyse with usual static approaches -- e.g., highly optimized or obfuscated code. The selected candidate will be able to rely on both our team's expertise on binary-level analysis, as well as the tools [BINSEC][website] and [PRECA][IJCAI2022] to carry out this task.

<strong>KEYWORDS</strong> - symbolic machine learning, formal methods, binary-level program analysis

<strong>SUPERVISION</strong> - [Grégoire Menguy][menguy] and [Sébastien Bardin][bardin].

<strong>HOSTING</strong> - You will be hosted at the [CEA in Saclay][nano].

<strong>To apply, please check out the [detailed application procedure and job info][procedure]</strong>.

<strong>When to apply</strong> - As soon as possible :-) We process the applications when they arrive, so don't be too late
