Summer is now over, students are back to school, but still we are glad
to announce the new BINSEC release **0.6.0**.

On the agenda:
- better support of `x86-64` VEX instructions, 
- new support of `RISC V` 64 bits architecture, 
- addition of a *stunning* exploration board in SSE.

When dealing with large binary programs where symbolic execution is
struggling, it may be frustrating to have to wait the end of the analysis
to obtain statistics about how it performed.
We now propose a new board to monitor in real-time what BINSEC is busy
doing behind the scene.

You can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/binsec/binsec/blob/e94c05bcd6741df91f180aef700e137008a9f64c/doc/sse/exploration_board.md).

So, do not miss the Opam release, have a look at the
[documentation](https://github.com/binsec/binsec/tree/master/doc/sse)
and do not hesitate to give feedbacks at

May the Fall be with you! :-)
